- There are 2 maven projects in the repository (both are not compiling, but that is irrelevant.)
- run (both commands will give errors, but those can be ignored):
  - `./mvnw -f openapi/pom.xml clean verify` 
  - `./mvnw -f openapi_old/pom.xml clean verify` 
- check the generated files in the target folder of the openapi project
  - `openapi/target/generated-sources/openapi/java/org/example/user/api/model`
  - `openapi_old/target/generated-sources/openapi/java/org/example/user/api/model`
- compare the generated files in the 2 folders
  - `openapi_old` will contain `UserDto.java` with the correct name.
  - `openapi` will contain `AddRequest.java` with the same content, but obviously with the wrong name.
